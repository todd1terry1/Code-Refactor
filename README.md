# Code-Refactor

This project was created to display a website that is focused on improving websites web accesibility. While working on this project I was tasked with refactoring the existing code.
In such, I made sure that all the links were working proerly, all duplicatated code was consolidated, the images displayed correctly and contained alt attributes just in case the picture did not show.
In this final product the funtionability of the website has not changed but the code is easier to read, it meets accesibility guidelines with semantic html elements, 
and the index.html and css files have been labeled for easy identification of elements, sections, classes, and attributes.
